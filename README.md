**Progress and impressions about How to use Git and Github**

[screenshot](./task_00/screenshot-task_0.png);

It was really awesome time, I get a lot of new information
about Git/Github and became more confident in this concepts:

1. git log 
2. git diff ( --staged)
3. git log --graph --oneline
4. fast-forward merge
